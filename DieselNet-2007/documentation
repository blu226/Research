These traces were collected in UMass DieselNet
in the month October-November 2007.


The released traces have five directories

1. gps_logs : This is the directory which has the cumulative
gps_logs for all the buses seen during the period which the 
traces were collected. There is a directory corresponding to every
bus and within each directory for a bus there are files for every 
day with a set of time stamped gps locations.

2. mobile-mobile: This is the collection of all the mobile-mobile contact
events. Each line includes the time at which a contact occured, the amount
of data that was transfered, the duration of contact and the position 
where the contact took place.

3. basestation-mobile: The traces are similar to the mobile-mobile traces
but are for the AP-mobile contact events.

4. mobile-mobile-mesh-relay: these are the traces for the connection events
between a mobile node and the six stationary relay/mesh boxes placed in the
network.
 
5. xtendtrace: This has the connection events between mobile nodes over
the Xtend Maxstream radio.
